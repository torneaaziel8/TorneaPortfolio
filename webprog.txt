		Hi, my name is Aziel Tornea and I'm 19 years old turning 20 on May 20 I live in the Philippines, Camarin Caloocan City. 
I am currently studying second-year college at N.U Fairview as BSIT-MI the skills I have is I can type 75-85 words per minute in Medium Text Level. I have experience coding in languages such as Python and Java but not at an advanced level, my skills in programming aren't that much 
I treat myself as a beginner because I still studying at school but I like to learn more. I really love music, music makes my life easier and more lively. I can play Piano and Guitar and singing is my hobby. 
I also find interesting the people who are great at singing, dancing, and any other things that they are great I also love playing basketball but I also know how to play table tennis, and volleyball and I used to play Badminton for my school way back in my elementary and high school days. 
That's the thing that makes my mood turn up, but the best thing for me is to spend time with my best friend Aikee, he always makes me happy. And also I believe me in saying that "Failure teaches me."
